# PGB - Gameboy emulator

PGB is a Gameboy emulator written in C as a hobby project.

## Build Dependencies

1. gcc
2. make
3. ronn (for generating manpages)

## Front ends

PGB itself is just a collection of function calls which emulates the Gameboy CPU, MMU, GPU, and Input devices.
To turn PGB into something usable, you will need to use an additional front-end for it. Currently, as a learning
project, PGB has been extended as a node napi module, and has an electron based UI. You can find the code for the napi
module [here](https://github.com/pacampbell/napi-pgb) and electron-ui [here](https://github.com/pacampbell/electron-pgb).

There also exists a command line based interface for debugging and simply testing out execution with.

## Make targets

The makefile supports a few different ways to build it.
